# A Rust Client for the RabbitMQ HTTP API

This is a Rust client for the [RabbitMQ HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management#http-api).

This is not an AMQP 0-9-1 client (see [amqprs](https://github.com/gftea/amqprs)), an AMQP 1.0 client (see [fe2o3-amqp](https://github.com/minghuaw/fe2o3-amqp)) or [RabbitMQ Stream protocol client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-rust-client) library.

## Project Maturity

This library is relatively young, breaking API changes are possible.
